This is a project I made while studying at Epitech, the instructions were simple:

> Given some X-ray images, use machine learning to help doctors detecting pneumonia.

I had no experience nor knowledge about AI prior to this project, so i set out to learn how neural networks work at their core. You can find the research paper [here](docs/Neural_Networks_And_Perceptrons.pdf)
